They say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis, but such action has not been taken to date.The controversial Keystone XL pipeline to transport tar sands oil from Canada to the US got the go-ahead, with $5bn in financial support from the Alberta government. US president Donald Trump called the move “GREAT news”. Other pipelines continued construction despite the lockdown.To “alleviate financial hardship” to the US fossil fuel industry, Trump directed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be filled to its maximum capacity.The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a sweeping suspension of its enforcement of environmental laws, three days after a request from the American Petroleum Institute, and extended the period that the more polluting winter gasoline can be sold.Three US states passed laws criminalising fossil fuel protests – South Dakota, Kentucky and West Virginia.Republican senators asked the US federal government to “reduce, delay or suspend” taxes due on oil, gas and coal, while the National Mining Association lobbied to cut $220m in taxes intended to support coal miners affected by black lung disease.

Cops – especially the one in Paris in 2015 – have changed attitudes and influenced policy.

Wind provides the cheapest energy, with the first subsidy-free contracts for offshore projects awarded last year. Onshore wind is even cheaper. It is also popular, scoring above other infrastructure (including roads and railway stations) in opinion polls despite the efforts of climate denialists to portray it as a public nuisance. Most importantly, it is renewable and very low-carbon. Unlike oil, gas and coal, wind does not produce greenhouse gases (apart from in the initial phase of manufacturing and installation) and is not something we can run out of. Unlike nuclear, it does not produce toxic waste as a byproduct.The government’s climate advisers say that onshore wind power capacity will need to triple in 15 years if the UK is to meet the target of net-zero emissions by 2050. This is a huge challenge, and forms just one part of an even bigger one. The good news is that the UK’s wind sector is already – and despite David Cameron’s foolish decision to stymie it – a world-beating one. While the solar power industry was seriously damaged by the removal of subsidies, with domestic installations collapsing after the withdrawal of feed-in tariffs, wind companies were able to shift resources and expertise offshore.

When I started year one we moved across the road from our school so we could manage ourselves in the morning. Related: Turning crap into gold: why a composting habit will change your life Make sure you start off with the right worms. Despite all this time you now have, do not go worm hunting in the garden! Leave those ones right alone. There are 6,000 known species of earthworms categorised in 20 families and not all of them are keen to eat your kitchen scraps. The most efficient worms available in Australia for composting are red worms, tiger worms and blue worms. You don’t need a fancy worm bin. A bucket with a spout that allows a bit of air flow is absolutely fine if you are composting indoors. Use any receptacle that you can drain, that doesn’t conduct too much heat. There are so many vermicomposting systems available, but I have found worm farming success is less about the container and more about the balance of contents you put into it. On our farm, old bath tubs propped up on some bricks are ideal as they come already complete with a drain hole. Whatever you choose make sure you can cover it up with a lid, wood plank or fine netted material. This helps by keeping out the fruit flies and undesirable pests and rodents. Another great system I use in our home garden is cutting out the bottom of a garbage bin and burying that straight into the ground with the lid intact. You can then fill the bottom with some bought worms, or wait for the earthworms already in your garden to come hither and then start composting straight away.Don’t overfeed your worms! When you’re first starting out, it’s easy to overwhelm your worms with too much food. Don’t get excited and start overfeeding them just to see what they can handle. You will likely be starting with 1,000 worms, which sounds like a lot but is actually only a large handful. They will multiply over time, but that doesn’t happen immediately, and you’ll end up with a smelly bin. Worms while efficient don’t work that fast, and you can help them by chopping up the food contents into smaller pieces.Break down your scraps by using a bokashi composting system first and then add the “cured’ scraps to your worm bin. This will help the worms break the compost down even more efficiently so you can add the vermicompost to your garden faster. Also, the bokashi will have somewhat neutralised the odour.No large bones and no citrus directly into the worm bin. Break down the citrus first in your bokashi or avoid putting it in altogether.Acidity is the enemy of a healthy worm composting system. If you find that you have an uncontrollable amount of fruit fly larvae in your bin, add a sprinkling of diatomaceous earth, not lime. In my experience the wrong kind of lime will kill invertebrates and upset the PH balance of the environment. So make sure you have a good balance of carbon to nitrogen. I find a little more carbon than nitrogen is the key. You can tell if you’ve got the right mix by eyeballing your bin contents – there should be a good ratio of carbon such as newspaper, empty loo rolls, egg cartons and leaf litter to nitrogen rich organic food matter, egg shells and dog poo.If you find that the bin starts to smell, add shredded newspaper and even torn-up egg cartons. Do that too if you are going away and cannot feed the worms for an extended period.Water your worms. They need a moist environment. A layer of wet newspaper over the contents also helps regulate the moisture. Use the dripping from your watering in your garden. Do not throw it out! You know when vermicompost is ready when it looks like soil and is neutral in odour. It should be a lovely dark colour and not soggy. It will hold a ball shape when you throw it into the air and be friable (easily crumbled). This is an indication that it contains water soluble nutrients and microbes. If you’ve got a large bin or bathtub, move the vermicompost to one side, then start another pile of food on the opposite end of the container. The worms will naturally migrate there. In a bin, once you have a rich vermicompost and the food looks completely digested, stop adding more food for a couple of days. You can sieve the worms out to separate them from the vermicompost and then start another lot. If you have too many worms, split the lot into another bin or gift them to someone – like a sourdough starter!Vermicast is an incredibly rich fertiliser. Besides the set-up cost of buying some worms, if you care for it a worm farm is essentially free continuous fertiliser, and a way to transform your garbage into food. Continue reading...\n",

How we dress feeds off cravings to be different as well as part of a tribe; to be en vogue but ahead of the pack. The message from the high street is that such wishes can be fulfilled, and fast fashion plays on the idea that hunger can be sated immediately. But to overcome such urges we need to reflect on the fragility of our planet. This means accepting that there is a better way to keep the pleasures of fashion open to all parts of society than promoting disposable clothes as desirable. This is not just about the high cost of the £4 dress; luxury retailers such as Louis Vuitton have offered small collections every two weeks.The fashion industry has benefited from globalisation to mass-produce goods by externalising the costs of production in the form of human and environmental damage.

            "summary: The oil industry saw its opening and moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of this momentI’m going to tell you the single worst story I’ve heard in these past few horrid months, a story that combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. I’m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it’s hard.The background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be “game over” for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the financing and permits, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It’s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.Bill McKibben is an author and Schumann distinguished scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College, Vermont.

            "summary:   Photo by Paco Serinelli / AFP via Getty Images  Another day, another oil giant pledging to fight climate change. Eni, one of the world’s biggest fossil fuel companies, announced today that its oil and gas production will peak in 2025. Earlier this month, BP said that it wants to virtually eliminate its greenhouse gases by 2050. Royal Dutch Shell and Spanish petroleum company Repsol have made promises to cut down on how much planet-heating pollution they put out, too. Yes, we now live in a world where corporations that make an extremely opulent living out of dredging up fossil fuels are competing with each other for green credentials. They’re somehow doing so without actually quitting the fossil fuels that are responsible for bringing about the climate crisis in the first place. Another day, another oil giant pledging to fight climate changeEni plans to cut down its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. That includes reining in emissions from the company’s operations and from the fossil fuel products it makes and sells. It says it will continue to up its production of oil and gas by 3.5 percent each year until 2025. After that, it will wind down how much oil it pumps out — but build up its gas output to 85 percent of its total production by 2050. Even though Eni also plans to generate renewable energy, that’s still a whole lot of fossil fuels it plans to dig up and sell.Eni’s commitment has been hailed as “among the most ambitious” pledges yet to take action on climate change from Big Oil and Gas. “Italian Giant Eni Sees Oil Peak Just Six Years Away,” reads a Bloomberg headline.Let’s put that timeline into context. The world is supposed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half in less than 10 years if it wants to avoid catastrophic climate change. By catastrophic, we’re talking changes that would essentially wipe out coral reefs and inundate a majority of the world’s coastlines. But we’re supposed to be relieved that in “just six years” Eni will begin to ramp down its fossil fuel output? Once its planned shift takes place in 2025, it will primarily be a transition from one fossil fuel to another. Eni’s biggest business by 2050 will be natural gas, which does let out less carbon dioxide than coal and oil when burned. But there’s more evidence than ever that methane leaks along the natural gas supply chain might cancel out much of those perceived climate gains. Natural gas is like the e-cigarette of fossil fuelsNatural gas is like the e-cigarette of fossil fuels. Its proponents call it a “bridge fuel” that can help wean humans off their fossil fuel addiction while societies build the infrastructure for a future that runs on renewable energy. Good intentions aside, turning to natural gas, like e-cigarettes, can be habit-forming. And if it makes up 85 percent of Eni’s production by 2050, natural gas is looking less like a bridge to a renewable future and more like… just the future. Never mind that by 2050, the world is supposed to have figured out how to get its greenhouse gas emissions to nearly zero in order to avoid that disastrous case climate scenario stated above, according to the United Nations panel of leading climate scientists.So while we may be seeing a domino effect when it comes to environmental promises from Big Oil and Gas, this is not the fall of fossil fuels science shows is necessary to stop the crisis they put us in. \n",

            "title:   Recycling plants are catching on fire, and lithium-ion batteries are to blame\n",
            "summary:   Unsorted recycling rides up a conveyor belt at a processing plant in Plano, Texas.  Rechargeable batteries like the one in your smartphone should never be tossed in the recycling  A nightmare for the recycling industry became incarnate when a Texas recycling plant burst into flames in December 2016. The fire caught quickly, melting plastic bottles, consuming cardboard boxes, and incinerating discarded paper. The massive building’s sprinkler system had been damaged in a recent freeze and failed to tamp down the flames. All the firefighters could do was keep the fire contained inside, watching it burn for 12 hours.By the next morning, it was clear that the facility, a recycling plant that serves the north Texas cities of Plano and Richardson, was a total loss. The fire’s likely cause? The company believes it was a lithium-ion battery, like the one in your cellphone or laptop.As lithium-ion batteries power more and more of our electronics, they are ending up in our recycling bins, and recycling plants are battling hundreds of battery-caused blazes. What we do with our batteries and electronics at the ends of their lives is fueling one of the biggest emerging problems in the world of waste.“What keeps me awake at night are these,” Amy Adcox, general manager of Republic Services Plano business unit, says as she waggles her phone. “The electronics.”                Inside the Plano, Texas, recycling facility. The conveyor belts help workers sort and package the recycling.  She’s standing on a metal platform in the state-of-the-art processing plant in Plano that Republic Services rebuilt after the 2016 fire. Beneath her feet, a conveyor belt rises diagonally from the concrete floor where collection trucks dump their hauls in huge piles, up to the vast web of platforms, conveyor belts, and equipment that sort recyclable materials from the garbage.Adcox’s smartphone, like virtually all smartphones, is powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. These batteries are small and lightweight and store lots of power. They’re also everywhere. In 2017, the global lithium-ion battery market was valued at more than $30 billion; by 2025, it is projected to grow to more than $100 billion. Standing in that recycling plant, Adcox had at least two rechargeable batteries on her person: in her phone and smartwatch.  “I personally am a big fan of the technology. I think lithium-ion is transformational,” says Ronald Butler, a battery safety expert. But these batteries also have to be handled properly, he says. If they get damaged, overheat, or short-circuit, a rechargeable battery will have what’s called a thermal runaway event, producing heat internally and getting hotter and hotter until it begins to smoke and then burn. Other batteries, like the old-school alkaline triple As, might contaminate a load of recyclable material if they get crushed or damaged. Lithium, on the other hand, burns hot and will quickly catch fire or explode.    Fires are not a new threat for the recycling industry, says Ryan Fogelman, vice president for strategic partnerships at Fire Rover, a company that makes fire prevention systems for industrial sites, including waste and recycling facilities. What’s changing is the frequency, he says. The number of fires at waste facilities across the United States and Canada increased by 26 percent from 2016 to 2019 — from 272 reported fires to 343, respectively — Fogelman finds in his 2019 annual waste and recycling facility fires report, which was published on February 25th. Fires are largely underreported, however, and Fogelman estimates that there were actually around 1,800 fires at waste facilities in 2019. “Nationally we’re losing about a facility a month, burned to the ground by battery fires,” says Bill Keegan, president of Dem-Con Companies in Minnesota. Dem-Con lost a waste transfer facility in September 2018 to a likely battery fire. Unlike other common fire threats to recycling facilities — including propane tanks, aerosol cans, and discarded fireworks — these batteries are small and often impossible to spot. A lithium-ion battery in a singing greeting card or a discarded e-cigarette pen is enough to spark a flame. Among the huge piles of waste, they are also virtually invisible. That may be the real danger with these batteries, says Fogelman. Plant workers often can’t see them until it’s too late.                 Recycling is dumped into a loader at the Plano, Texas facility.  Most battery fires happen on that concrete “tipping floor” where collection trucks dump their loads. When they spill out of the truck into the open space, damaged batteries suddenly have the oxygen they need to start a fire. To address this threat, the new Plano facility features a massive concrete and metal fire wall to separate the tipping floor from the rest of the plant. There’s also a Fire Rover heat-sensitive camera and an automated foam cannon to smother flames. A line of neon-clad employees at the mouth of the first conveyor belt pick out as much problematic garbage as possible. But despite those precautions, Adcox lives in fear of one of these batteries sneaking up into the belly of the plant itself and damaging the equipment and posing a hazard to her employees. That’s what happened at a similar facility in San Mateo County, California, in 2016, causing a four-alarm fire fought by 100 firefighters and a four-month plant closure. Unfortunately, “the conveyor belt forms a very efficient way to transport the fire throughout the plant,” says Joe La Mariana, CEO of the South Bayside Waste Management Authority (Rethink Waste), a public agency that manages the plant.All of these fires are, of course, physically dangerous, but they also pose an existential threat to the industry, says La Mariana. Recycling companies can lose customers to competitors for years after a plant fire. Employees have to be furloughed until the plant can be rebuilt. Insurance premiums skyrocket.  Since reopening in spring 2019, workers at the Plano facility have already dealt with three small fires. One was definitely caused by a laptop, the other a cordless vacuum. The vacuum fire had to be put out on the customer’s front lawn since the battery caught fire as waste haulers attempted to unload a curbside recycling bin.Most people mean well when they attempt to recycle electronics at the curb. They’re almost certainly not scheming to burn entire factories to the ground with illicit batteries. But the risk remains, which is why that combustible battery should never go in your home recycling. Instead, they should go to designated drop-off centers to be properly, and safely, disposed of or recycled. Your local recycling plant will thank you.Photography by Jillian Mock for The Verge\n",

            "title:   How Elizabeth Warren answered a hard question about lithium-ion batteries\n",
            "summary:   Photo by Ethan Miller / Getty Images  The controversial sourcing of lithium-ion batteries briefly took center stage at the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday night in a question directed at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). “The tension here in this state is between people who want renewable energy and people who want conservation on public lands,” said moderator Jon Ralston. He pointed out that Warren had pledged to sign an executive order to stop drilling on public lands on her first day in office. “You’ve got to have lithium, you’ve got to have copper for renewable energy. How do you do that?” he asked Warren.Nevada has a huge reserve of lithium on public landSwitching to electric-powered vehicles and solar energy will be a big piece of the puzzle when it comes to the US weaning itself off planet-heating fossil fuels. That technology requires lithium-ion batteries, and Nevada has a huge reserve of lithium on public land.Thacker Pass in Humboldt County, Nevada, is one of those potential sources of lithium. A Canadian company, Lithium Americas has been planning to develop the site, which the company estimates is the largest deposit of lithium in the United States. Lithium Americas’ proposal to mine the Thacker Pass deposit is currently under review by the US Bureau of Land Management. The company hopes to retrieve between 30,000 to 60,000 tons of battery-grade lithium carbonate at the location every year for about 40 years, starting in 2022. It says it could supply “most or all” of the US’s demand for lithium. Although the company says the operation would bring jobs on top of supplying the transition to more renewable energy, some Nevada residents are concerned about having an open-pit mine essentially in their backyards. “Well, it takes out a lot of our range, and it has a huge economic impact for us,” Cattle rancher Jhona Bell told the Mountain West News Bureau. “Obviously you can’t run cattle where there’s a mine.” People can submit their comments about the Thacker Pass mine to the Bureau of Land Management through February 27th. Building batteries without harming people and the environment remains one of the biggest problems to solve when it comes to getting the world on clean energy. Mining for lithium has dried up lagoons and used up groundwater locals depend on in Chile, which is estimated to hold almost half the world’s lithium reserves. Building batteries without harming people and the environment remains one of the biggest problems to solveThe cobalt that’s also needed to make lithium-ion batteries has led to child labor in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; Apple, Google, and Tesla are facing a lawsuit over child deaths as a result. Finding new places to mine that won’t harm people has ocean advocates concerned about deep-sea mining destroying ecosystems before we even have the chance to understand them. “Mining, metals, and materials extraction is the hidden foundation of the low-carbon transition. But it is far too dirty, dangerous, and damaging to continue on its current trajectory,” Benjamin Sovacool, a professor of energy policy at the University of Sussex, said in a statement when he published a policy paper in the journal Science last month. Sovacool argued that the success of efforts to take on climate change will depend on how responsibly leaders manage demand for minerals like lithium and cobalt. Warren responded to the question of how to get the raw materials needed to power a greener energy infrastructure in the US by saying that she might make some exceptions when it comes to protecting public lands from mining. “If we need to make exceptions because there are specific minerals that we’ve got to have access to, then we locate those and we do it not in a way that just is about the profits of giant industries, but in a way that is sustainable for the environment,” Warren said at the debate. She and other Democratic candidates are vying for environmentally minded voters as climate change becomes a bigger election issue. So how to build a low-carbon energy infrastructure without damaging communities and the environment in the process is a question that’s likely to pop up on the campaign trail again. \n",

            "summary:   Photo by Stefan Sauer/picture alliance via Getty Images  Humans are responsible for as much as 40 percent more methane emissions than previously estimated, according to a new study published in the journal Nature today. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that can be produced biologically, seep out of the ground naturally, or bubble out of mud volcanoes. It’s also a potent byproduct of fossil fuel production. Combined, both natural- and human-released methane emissions are responsible for about a quarter of the global warming we’re experiencing. But human-released methane makes up a much bigger slice of those emissions than people originally thought, the study’s findings suggest. They found that human-caused methane emissions might be 25 to 40 percent higher than prior estimates. Previous measurements of how much naturally occurring methane is heating up the planet were an order of magnitude too big, the researchers found. There is an upside to all of this: the findings also imply that there’s an even bigger opportunity to rein in how much methane we release. Methane is more potent than carbon dioxide, so slashing it from our global greenhouse gas emissions can have an outsized effect. Most human-caused methane is inadvertently leaked while producing and transporting gas and oil, so improving those systems “could give us a pretty big bang for a buck,” says Andrew Rice, an associate professor at Portland State University who was not involved with the study. “The onus is on us.”“The onus is on us to recognize that we can, at the very least, try to get the [oil and gas] industry to quantify these in a better sense, because what I indicate is that they’re vastly under reporting it,” lead author Benjamin Hmiel tells The Verge. To conduct this study, Hmiel and his colleagues studied ice core measurements from Greenland between 1750 to 2013 on top of previous data from Antarctica. They used the isotope carbon-14 as a sort of chemical fingerprint to determine whether the methane present in the ice core came from biological sources like cows and bacteria or emerged from underground deposits. (If it has carbon-14, it came from living things.)Until roughly 1870, biological sources dominated the ices cores. But around that time, fossil fuel production started picking up, and researchers saw a huge jump in methane that didn’t have any carbon-14. That allowed them to estimate what was seeping out of the ground naturally in pre-industrial times and compare it to what people are currently seeing in the atmosphere. The difference is due to human activity.Previous efforts to quantify anthropogenic methane measured emissions directly at each potential source — from seeps to oil wells. The difficulty in doing that is one reason why the study’s findings are “actually not that surprising,” according to Eric Kort, an associate professor at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study. Methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal activities tend to systematically be underestimated, he says, in part because they often use averages for emissions and don’t take into account hardware failures or other errors that lead to unintentional leaks. “a really Herculean effort”Hmiel’s approach to measuring methane emissions is “a really Herculean effort that involves — no joke — each sample is about 1000 kilograms of ice that we have to melt,” he says. But it does come with one large limitation: nuclear bombs and reactors put more carbon-14 in the atmosphere, messing with the study’s reading of carbon-14 in methane in samples from 1945 or later (after the first nuclear bombs were deployed). For those later samples, the study authors had to use computer models to make the rest of their estimates of human-caused methane. So while this study offers a promising new way of understanding humanity’s impact on the climate through methane, “it will require additional modeling, to verify if this is going to fly, basically,” Rice says.\n",

            "summary:   The kites are attached to buoys out at sea, and use turbines to generate power. | Image: Alphabet  Alphabet is ending its work on Makani, a project that tried to generate power using wind turbines attached to kites, Makani’s CEO has announced. Despite successfully demonstrating a flight off the coast of Norway last year, the CEO said that business and technology challenges meant that “the road to commercialization is longer and riskier than hoped.” Energy company Shell, which collaborated with Makani on last year’s flight, is “exploring options” to take on its tech, according to the Financial Times.Makani is the first of Alphabet’s moonshot projects to have been shuttered since Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped back from the business last December. Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai is under pressure to reduce Alphabet’s losses from its “Other Bets” segment. The Financial Times notes that last year the division lost the company $4.8 billion, up from $3.4 billion the year before. The closure appears to be part of wider cost-cutting at Alphabet. Earlier this week Google announced it would be ending its work on Stations, a free Wi-Fi project aimed at developing countries.Google’s “Other Bets” segment lost the company $4.8 billion last yearThe executive in charge of Alphabet’s X division, Astro Teller, said it’s necessary to focus Alphabet’s investments on the climate change technology that can have the “greatest impact.” Teller, who is also the chairman of Makani’s board, said that “while it’s tempting to say that all climate-related ideas deserve investment, remaining clear-eyed and directing resources to the opportunities where we think we can have the greatest impact isn’t just good business; it’s essential when it comes to a problem as urgent as the climate crisis.” The statement was reported by TechCrunch. Makani achieved some successes during its seven years under the Alphabet umbrella. It developed its 20kW demonstrator kite into a “utility-scale” model that’s capable of generating 600kW, and which has some advantages over traditional offshore wind turbines. The kites are attached to floating buoys out at sea, and don’t need the expensive ocean platforms required by typical offshore wind farms. The design also means the turbines can be used in windy areas where the ocean is considered too deep for traditional wind farms.However, voices both inside and outside of Alphabet raised concerns about the project’s progress. In 2018 an EU report pointed out that “the technology still has a long way to go before it can reach commercialisation,” according to the Financial Times. It said that the concept would not be viable until the team could demonstrate that it could operate reliably and autonomously.                Image: Google      Makani’s current kite generates 600kW of electricity.  First founded in 2006, Makani was acquired by Google in 2013 and integrated into the company’s Google X moonshot wing. Then, last year it was spun out into its own business. Alphabet now hopes to reassign Makani’s “dozens” of employees to other climate change-related projects within the company, while a small team will collate the project’s research to allow it to become useful for others.Energy company Shell has expressed an interest in continuing Makani’s work. “We believe that Makani remains one of the leading airborne-wind technologies in the world and we are exploring options to continue developing the technology within our New Energies strategy,” the company’s vice-president of Wind Development, Dorine Bosman, told the Financial Times.\n",

            "summary:   Photo by Mark Ralston / AFP via Getty Images  “Invisible oil” escaped the view of satellites that were tasked with measuring the extent of the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, according to a new study. In the Science Advances article, researchers argue that updated techniques need to be deployed alongside satellite measurements to track future oil spills below the water’s surface.BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig spewed more than 200 million gallons into the Gulf in 2010. At the time, satellite readings were used to determine which areas in the Gulf were off-limits to fishing, but the dangers posed by the spilled oil to fish and the humans who eat them spread beyond those boundaries. In places where oil from the spill was no longer visible from space, it still persisted in concentrations that were enough to be toxic. The extent of the spill could have been as much as 30 percent larger than previous estimates, according to study authors.New computer models can now more accurately predict how a spill will spread. Used in tandem with satellite remote sensing and measurements taken at the site of the spill, these advancements can make for a faster and more effective cleanup in the event of another disaster. “there will be another oil spill like that.”“Eventually, there will be another oil spill like that,” cautions Claire Paris-Limouzy, an author of the report and a biological oceanographer at the University of Miami. “I’m definitely concerned,” she says, pointing to offshore oil drilling at deeper and deeper depths.Paris-Limouzy and her colleagues looked at water and sediment samples, satellite and aerial images, and modeled how oil droplets might have moved through the water over time — factoring in currents, temperature, how the oil degrades, and other factors. Although the spill took place almost 10 years ago, some of the data wasn’t released until recently. Putting the different sources of information together allowed the researchers to have a more comprehensive view of what was going on in the Gulf immediately after the spill. Their technique, they hope, will change the way authorities respond to future spills. “The less uncertainty you have about where the oil will go, the better the response will be,” says Paris.Satellites face some obvious challenges when it comes to peering into the depths of the sea. “There was no one satellite able to observe all the time, everywhere, and the spill was big,” says Ira Leifer, a researcher at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Leifer was a member of a technical group tasked with putting together official estimates of the flow of oil from the spill, but he was not involved in this study. Leifer says the study confirms what a decade of observations, medical records, and anecdotes had implied: “the impact of this spill was larger than generally publicized,” he says.  Satellites have gotten more advanced since Deepwater Horizon, and they’re still a necessary go-to for assessing oil spills, Leifer and other experts tell The Verge. Leifer says satellites are important for studying areas that aren’t easy for humans to get to, and getting their data is often cheaper than deploying a team to take measurements in the field. And most marine oil spills occur on the surface from boats, making it easier to assess from above. “You can leverage the power of satellites.”The study doesn’t discount how important satellite data is when it comes to cleaning up a spill. It just says that researchers shouldn’t stop there. Leifer points out that satellite remote sensing can better inform efforts to gather data on the ground — or in this case, on the water — especially when resources are scarce. “You can leverage the power of satellites to wisely use your resources, it builds the foundation,” he says.The horrific damage from Deepwater Horizon, one of the most catastrophic oil spills on record, catalyzed efforts to hold oil companies accountable for their effects on the environment. BP, which a US federal judge ruled was responsible for “gross negligence” and “willful misconduct” for the spill, announced yesterday that it wants to take efforts to eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil fuels it produces. The details of how, exactly, it would do that have yet to be released.\n",

It’s still unclear how a company that sells the stuff that heats up the planet — it plans to continue pumping out fossil fuels despite this announcement — will achieve that net-zero goal.The company says its ambition is to slash emissions from its operations and from the burning of the fossil fuels it sells. It will also invest more in alternatives to oil and gas over time, although it didn’t set out a deadline for the transition. BP also announced plans to fundamentally restructure the company in order to achieve its aims.“It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it”“Trillions of dollars will need to be invested in replumbing and rewiring the world’s energy system. It will require nothing short of reimagining energy as we know it,” CEO Bernard Looney said in a statement.But exactly what form that reimagining will take remains to be seen. The company is one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. It produced about 8.6 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2018, and 2.64 million barrels of oil equivalent every day in 2019. In a QA, Looney said that the company would “very likely” still be producing and refining hydrocarbons by 2050, but that it planned to invest “less and less in oil and gas” over time.It’s easier for a company to reign in emissions from its direct operations; many companies making net-zero pledges have stopped short of counting the climate pollution generated from customers using their products, called “Scope 3 emissions.” This is even tricker for an oil company like BP, which makes its money by selling emissions-generating fuels. The company now says it wants to get rid of the greenhouse gases that come from burning its oil and gas after it’s sold. The overwhelming majority of BP’s emissions come from customers burning its fuels, Bloomberg reports.Important clarification from BP spokesperson: The BP climate plan includes cutting majority of Scope 3 emissions, about 360 million tons out of the 437 million tons That is, net zero on oil and gas BP extracts and sells. But not yet on crude it buys, refines, and sells.— Akshat Rathi (@AkshatRathi) February 12, 2020As the climate crisis worsens, lawsuits have been aimed at Big Oil and Gas while activists and politicians have called for a switch to renewables. Reactions to BP’s latest announcement from people advocating for change have been mixed. Some investors have hailed the net-zero announcement as groundbreaking, but others have been unimpressed. “This isn’t ambitious or anywhere near enough,” Greenpeace UK said in response to BP on Twitter. With its new goal, BP appears to be making the case that fossil fuels can somehow still power the future — it just needs to figure out its carbon dioxide problem. How, exactly, it’s going to do that — along with the greenhouse gases it’s responsible for — are still up in the air. The company plans to set out more of its strategy and short-term plans in September. \n",

That’s significantly more than the $824 million Trump proposed in his budget the previous year. Even with the sizable increase in requested funds, the amount is less than the $1.5 billion that Congress allocated for nuclear energy last year.Trump sold the bump in funding as a way to promote “revitalization of the domestic industry and the ability of domestic technologies to compete abroad.” His administration also wants to ramp up uranium production in the US, calling it “an issue of national security.”Stocks tied to uranium  nuclear energy moving higher-$CCJ $UEC (micro cap)Per @FactSet: could be fueled by White House FY2021 budget proposal that requests $1.2B for RD  other nuclear energy programs, and looks to establishes a U.S. Uranium reserve— Morgan Brennan (@MorganLBrennan) February 10, 2020Keeping the nation’s nuclear reactors online has been a priority for Trump since taking office. Two bills he signed into law sped up the development of advanced nuclear reactors and streamlined the permitting processes. He’s also allocated funds, including $300 million in this year’s proposal, toward a Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) meant to test and develop advanced reactor fuels and materials. Nuclear power currently makes up 20 percent of the US energy mix and half of its carbon-free electricity. Nevertheless, nuclear energy has struggled to gain a larger foothold in the US.“I personally do not see nuclear power as a way around the production of greenhouse gas emissions,” former executive director of Columbia University’s Earth Institute Steven Cohen tells The Verge in an email. “On the other hand, scientific research on nuclear energy as well as other forms of energy and energy storage should be a high priority for our national labs and research universities.”Among Democrats and environmentalists, scaling up nuclear power as a potential climate change fix has been a divisive, hot-button issue. Fans say the technology is now much safer than previous iterations, and that it’s a necessary tool alongside wind and solar in the battle to stop climate change. Detractors focus on the high costs of nuclear energy and point out that the US still doesn’t exactly know what to do with all its nuclear waste.nuclear power as a potential climate change fix has been a divisive, hot-button issueLast week, Trump seemingly backed away from a proposed waste site at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been controversial ever since it was proposed in 1987. The proposed dump for radioactive waste is political kryptonite for someone who might want the state’s votes (Trump lost Nevada in 2016). “Nevada, I hear you on Yucca Mountain and my Administration will RESPECT you!” Trump tweeted on February 6th. “My Administration is committed to exploring innovative approaches – I’m confident we can get it done!” Trump had previously asked for funds to complete the nuclear waste repository in previous budget proposals. While environmentalists continue to debate the pros and cons of nuclear energy, Trump does not appear to be boosting nuclear as a specifically environmental priority. His budget proposal also slashed the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by 26 percent. Trump’s $4.8 trillion budget proposal still needs to make its way through Congress, where it’s likely to face a fight. But there has been bipartisan support for nuclear energy in the past — last year, Congress upped the 2020 budget for nuclear energy by nearly $700 million. “This sends a strong message that the Department of Energy (DOE) is all in on new nuclear,” Rita Baranwal, assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy, said in a statement after Trump signed off on the 2020 spending bill in December.\n",

            "summary:   Photo by Sarah Silbiger/Getty Images  The idea of a National Climate Bank is catching on in Congress, and it could infuse billions of dollars into efforts to eliminate the US’s planet-heating carbon emissions. A handful of Congressional proposals have been made over the past year calling for the government to start investing in technology upgrades and inventions that would cut down on greenhouse gases. Funds from the National Climate Bank would ideally lower the financial risks associated with green innovation — encouraging private investors to throw more money into the pot, without shifting costs to consumers. The hope is that the bank can tackle everything from building up the infrastructure for electric vehicles and solar power storage, to making communities more resilient to the effects of climate change. A National Climate Bank is at the center of a broad set of policies proposed this month by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The effort, called the Climate Leadership and Environmental Action for our Nation’s (CLEAN) Future Act, is aimed at bringing greenhouse gas emissions down to essentially zero by 2050. The National Climate Bank would pull together the public and private investment needed to transition to an economy with pretty much no carbon footprint. It builds on bills introduced in both the House and Senate that would create an independent nonprofit bank capitalized with $35 billion in federal funds. That bank could mobilize up to $1 trillion in total public and private investment over three decades, advocates estimate.  encouraging private investors to throw more money into the potIt’s a business-friendly environmental strategy with bipartisan appeal and a proven track record thanks to the success of state and local green banks, advocates of the national bank say. “I think this should be one of the less controversial provisions that people talk about, because I don’t care who you are, we need to be investing in innovation and technology,” Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-MI) tells The Verge. Dingell introduced the National Climate Bank Act bill in the House in December. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced a similar bill in the Senate in July. The bank they’re proposing would be able to fund projects directly and funnel cash into existing regional green banks. Over the past decade, state and city green banks have popped up across the US. These aren’t banks you deposit money into. They bring together public, private, and philanthropic capital to push clean energy projects forward that otherwise might not get off the ground. Since the the concept first got rolling in 2009, 14 green banks across the nation have generated $3.67 billion in clean energy investment, according to an annual report from the American Green Bank Consortium, a membership organization for green banks and financing groups. Congresswoman Dingell points to Michigan’s green bank, Michigan Saves, as one successful model. It’s financed about $220 million in local environmental projects since its founding in 2009. For each public dollar the state puts in, it can mobilize $30 in private investment, according to Michigan Saves president and CEO Mary Templeton. A majority of that has gone to residents who, say, want to upgrade their homes with solar power or insulation to become more energy efficient. The challenges the bank faces now, Templeton tells The Verge, have to do with scaling up and reaching low to moderate income communities where some people might not quality for traditional credit. The National Climate Bank could help in both areas, she hopes. And there’s another green bank floating around Congress that could give Michigan Saves a boost too. The Green Bank Act of 2019 has also been introduced by legislators in both chambers. That would set up a United States Green Bank within the Department of the Treasury, which would issue up to $50 billion in Green Bonds as a way to provide more capital to state and local green banks.The idea for a National Climate Bank has failed in Congress before. Legislative efforts to establish such a bank flopped in 2009, 2014, and 2017. And the business-friendly appeal of a National Climate Bank hasn’t gained as much traction with more left-leaning Democrats. The push for the bank has for the most part come from moderate Democrats who are less skeptical of relying on the market to fix the problems it created with its dependence on fossil fuels.Things could be different this time around. Writing the National Climate Bank into the CLEAN Future Act, which has been billed as a more moderate alternative to the Green New Deal, is a sign that the idea could be gaining ground. And with United Nations scientists advising that the world needs to cut its carbon habit by 2050 to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change, urgency is building to take action and involve the private sector.“It’s not Wall Street’s job to solve climate change,” says Jeffrey Schub, executive director of the Coalition for Green Capital, which has pushed the green bank and climate bank bills. Still, he adds, “There are self-interested reasons they should want to invest in decarbonization.” Schub points out that there are “unimaginably large” risks to businesses associated with climate change. The climate crisis could cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year by 2090, by some estimates.  “laying out blueprints for climate action in 2021”Climate change has also emerged as a key 2020 election issue for Democrats, and people are already placing early bets on the policies that could move forward if a Democrat is elected the next president. “The window of opportunity and interest is growing at the federal level right now,” says Schub. “Lots of smart folks realize that now is the time to start laying out blueprints for climate action in 2021.”Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that Ed Markey is a senator from New York. Markey is a senator from Massachusetts. We regret the error.\n",

            "summary:   Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  Humanity is now 100 seconds away from the apocalypse, according to the Doomsday Clock, which was updated today. That’s 20 metaphorical seconds closer to the moment humans destroy the planet, at least according to a group of scientists who keep track of the many ways humanity might bring about its own end. it’s the closest humans have been to the end of daysThis is the closest humans have been to the end of days — aka midnight — according to the nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The Bulletin’s science and security board convened in November to decide what time to set the clock. The time was set long before heightened military actions between the US and Iran and before North Korea’s decision to end its freeze on nuclear testing. Those events only confirmed the Bulletin’s consensus that humanity is in graver danger than ever before, board member Sharon Squassoni said. But they also seemed to suggest that the clock’s meager move might have lowballed the risks at hand. The organization started the clock in 1947 as the nuclear arms race began, and it has since focused on risks from nuclear technology and climate change. This year, concerns over Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs and disintegrating cooperation between the US and Russia on disarmament prompted the Bulletin’s board of scientists and experts to move the clock forward. So, too, did inadequate action on climate change. “I must say as I listened to the excellent but devastating presentation of the scientists, I felt more and more a strong personal reaction — the reaction of an angry granny,” former president of Ireland and climate action advocate Mary Robinson said at the announcement. “This is not acceptable.” Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and former California Gov. Jerry Brown also spoke at the event. “the reaction of an angry granny”Information warfare is also contributing to the spread of misinformation and crippling humanity’s ability to respond to the dangers we face, according to the Bulletin. It called out the Trump administration for disbanding science committees and sowing distrust in the media by labeling it “fake news.” Deepfakes could make it harder for people and policymakers to discern truth from lies, the Bulletin warned. Facebook is already grappling with how to limit misinformation from deepfakes on its platform, and it has moved to ban them ahead of the 2020 US presidential election.The last time the clock ticked forward was in 2018 when it moved up 30 seconds to reach two minutes before midnight. At the time, escalating tensions between nuclear powers and the buildup of a nuclear arsenal by North Korea, India, Pakistan, Russia, and the US had the Bulletin most worried. The clock had reached two minutes to midnight only once before: in 1953 when world powers were locked in a nuclear arms race.Deepfakes make it harder to discern truth from liesThe clock stayed put in 2019, but that still wasn’t great news. The failure to address the threats posed by climate change kept the Bulletin from moving the time further away from midnight. Since then, the world remains on a catastrophic path toward warming of 3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. “We have no reason to believe that such a world would remain hospitable to human civilization,” said Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environmental Institute, during the announcement. Back in 1991, the clock’s hands were positioned the farthest away from midnight that they’ve ever been. Thanks to the end of the Cold War and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed by the US and Soviet Union, the Bulletin moved the clock back to 17 minutes from midnight. Although it’s backed up by legitimate scientific and geopolitical analysis, the Doomsday Clock is a gimmick. There’s no need to start building your doomsday bunker just yet. The clock is meant to serve as “a reminder of the perils we must address if we are to survive on the planet,” according to the Bulletin. \n",

            "summary: The Trump administration will once again withdraw an exclusion it had previously granted to two-sided solar panels,after determining the bifacial solar panel exclusion is undermining the objectives of the Section 201 tariffs placed on solar cells and modules in January 2018. The U.S. Trade Representative published the withdrawal notice in the Federal Register on Friday.The move would eliminate theuncertainty surrounding the exemptionwhich had been instituted, withdrawn and reestablished over the course of several months last yearbut its sure to be met with opposition from some segments of the solar industry.The exclusion for bifacial panels, one of two the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) granted to the solar tariffs, set off a tussle within the solar industry when it was established in June 2019. Companies that had invested in U.S. manufacturing plants in the wake of the Section 201 tariffs, such as Hanwha Q Cells, and an original petitioner of the tariffs, Suniva, opposed the exclusion, arguing it helped internationally manufactured panels undercut domestically produced product. The vast majority of bifacial panels are made outside the U.S. But the industrys largest U.S. trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, has contended the exclusion provides vital support to a budding technology. Just before the administration withdrew the bifacial exemption in October, developer Invenergy Renewables filed a legal challenge arguing that theUSTR hadnt allowed for proper comment or notice prior to the withdrawal. In December, the U.S. Court of International Trade sided with Invenergy, allowing the exclusion to stand. In January, the administration restarted the process by requesting comment on the future of the exclusion. The court must lift its injunction for the withdrawal to apply.Though two-sided solar panels represent a small proportion of those used in U.S. solar installations to date, they are quickly becoming the norm for some developers. BP-backed solar developer Lightsource, for instance, has used the technology in all its projects since mid-2019. By 2022, IHS Markit forecasts bifacial modules will make up one-third of worldwide production.In the shorter term, SEIA told Greentech Media, the industry viewed the exclusion as a means to cope with an acute shortage of domestic panels available to U.S. utility-scale projects.Throughout this process, the solar industry has sought to find a middle-ground solution that addressed this shortage in a way that did not undermine the objectives of the underlying Section 201 safeguard measure, said John Smirnow, general counsel and vice president of market strategy at the trade group, in an emailed statement.But theUSTR suggested the exemption could provide undue momentum for the technology as its already growing in popularity.Bifacial panels are projected to gain a large share of total demand in the coming years due to their power-generation advantages and relative cost-competitiveness with monofacial panels  particularly the price advantage that the bifacial exclusion conferred upon them, states the USTR order. Accordinglythe bifacial exclusion (a) likely will result in substantial increases in imports of bifacial panels, and (b) that these products likely will compete with domestically produced solar products in the U.S. market.The administration also argued the exclusion disincentivized domestic production of bifacial solar panels. In the wake of the Section 201 tariffs, companies opened up five module manufacturing facilities in the U.S., amounting to 3 gigawatts of capacity. None of the facilities producebifacial panels on a significant scale.SEIA said Friday it would continue to pursuelitigation related to the exclusion.If additional legal challenges follow, the fight over the exclusion could last as long as the tariffs themselves, which are currently slated to end in 2022. In February, the U.S. International Trade Commission sent a midterm review of the tariffs impact to the president. Its now up to Trump to decide whether to modify the duties.This story has been updated with commentfrom SEIA related to litigation.\n",

But the projects collaborative business model also makes it potentially groundbreaking for energy storage development, by formalizing the use of the battery for discrete grid services on behalf of two different clients.PGE, which is working to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of June, has experience building batteries and contracting with third parties for the use of their batteries. Battery owners often contract services to an offtaker while playing in merchant markets themselves. But the Oakland project marks a new foray into an owner sharing a front-of-meter battery plant with multiple customers.Independent power producer Vistra Energy, which owns the 165-megawatt jet-fueled plant in question, signed a deal with PGE to build a 36.25-megawatt/145-megawatt-hour battery at the existing site in Jack London Square. The facility will provide local area reliability service, helping the utility with its job of transmitting power to residents in Oakland. Doing so avoids a far costlier investment, like running new wires over the hills from the Moraga substation.But those consumers now buy their power from a community-choice aggregator called East Bay Community Energy, a locally administered group dedicated to rapidly scaling up clean energy. EBCE contracted with Vistra last year to use the same battery as a capacity source to fulfill its resource adequacy requirements, which provide power to ride out extreme peak events. The battery originally was going to deliver 20 megawatts/80 megawatt-hours, but the planned capacity has expanded since then.The double-dipping addresses a structural challenge facing the rise of storage technology on the grid: Batteries can do all sorts of useful things, but its often hard to find one customer that needs all of those capabilities. A world that constrainedbatteries to single uses for single customers would result in redundancy and inefficiency compared to a system where multiple stakeholders use the same equipment for different purposes.\"This is a prime example of collaboration as innovation recognizing energy storages value tobothparties may be the only wayeitherparty can capture that value,\" said Daniel Finn-Foley, energy storage director at Wood Mackenzie.\"Providing either resource adequacy to EBCE or a non-wires solution to PGE may not have been bankable, but by contracting withbothentities, both problems get solved and the system is fully recognized for its value.\"The regulatory backdrop here is in some sense specific to California. The state allowed local populations to form community-choice aggregators, giving them control over power purchasing and pricing for customersbut leaving it to the utilities to manage the power delivery. EBCE pulled away PGE customers in the East Bay, and that came with an obligation to provide for their peak power needs.Most states lack this sort of arrangement. But its quite common to see storage contracts that cannot account for the full value of the asset due to legal limitations on what certain energy companies can do. This typically happens in markets where regulated utilities manage the wiresand private investors engage in market competition to supply generation, as in Texas and many states in the Northeast.For instance, a wires utility could use a battery to avoid a costly transmission expansion,but not if it putsthem into the generation business. Conversely, a generator could use the battery to deliver capacity at a valuable grid node where gas plant development would not be feasible, but it has no role to play in the transmission and distribution of power. These firm distinctions predate the rise of grid batteries, which defy easy categorization due to their wide-ranging technical capabilities.Vistras Oakland battery still needs approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. After that, its supposed to be up and running by January 2022. If all that happens and it operates in a way that satisfies its clients, the project will prove that a more collaborative world is possible.That doesnt mean this model could work everywhere, given the variations in market rules from state to state. But where it does work, it promises better project economics through cost-sharing among more stakeholders, and more efficient use of grid infrastructure, all while replacing polluting plants with non-emitting boxes of batteries.\n",

            "title:   Most Solar Panel Warranties Last 25 Years. Europe’s Plant Owners Are Counting on Much More\n",
            "summary: European solar asset owners are grappling with the prospect of longer-lived projects after a 2019 ruling upped the definition of the useful life of plants to 35 years. The figure represents a big increase over the traditionally accepted lifespan of 25 years, which is based on standard PV panel warranty periods.The legal precedent appeared in a ruling against Spain by the World Banks International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) last September, following a lawsuit brought by solar investors OperaFund Eco-Invest and Schwab Holding over retroactive feed-in tariff cuts.In the fight to reduce its liability, Spains legal team had argued that solar plants had a 30-year lifespan. ICSID found otherwise, accepting expert testimony that said the plaintiffs plants could have carried on working for a minimum of 35 years.Buried in a 308-page ruling, the legal rubber-stamping of a minimum 35-year lifespan attracted little fanfare. In part, thats because the solar industry is already assuming its plants will last well over 25 years, said &Aacute;lvaro Payn Rodrguez, general manager at Seville-based ATA Renewables, who acted as an expert witness in the ICSID case.The fact that plants last longer than 25 years is something that everyone knows, he said. You will have to replace certain components, such as inverters, and invest some money, but you can extend the lifespan by five, 10 or 15 years.Massaging the economics of solarIn the U.S., the National Renewable Energy Laboratory lists photovoltaic plants as having a useful life of 25 to 40 years.And in Europe, analysts believe developers have only been able to win tenders at ultra-low prices because plants will continue to deliver power on a merchant basis for many years after original contracts for difference or power-purchase agreements (PPAs) run out.Being able to play with an extra decade or two of production is handy for asset owners, said Luca Pedretti, chief operations officer and co-founder of Pexapark, a Swiss PPA software management firm. Just mathematically, LCOE [levelized cost of energy] will go down, he said.In the official financial model, I guess you will not see yet 35 [years], but I think thats a common trick. They have a base case and they know they can massage it. If you can play this game for another five to 10 years, it is, of course, better.But banking on a minimum 35-year plant lifespan also carries some risk. There is minimal long-term operational data of projects with current technology,\" said Kurt Bastian, senior consultant at the technical advisory firm K2 Management.There is uncertainty associated with extrapolating long-term performance. For example, the reduced thickness of silicon is a key driver in the reduction of module price we have seen in recent years, and the long-term degradation impact of this increasingly brittle material is unknown.The danger of optimismIn the absence of lifelong performance data, Bastian worries some asset owners may be overly optimistic about the capabilities of their plants.Most modules are expected to see a degradation rate of 0.7 percent a year over their 25-year warranty period, for example, but many developers take the view that actual rates could be as low as 0.25 percent, albeit with very limited evidence of this being achievable in the near term, Bastian said.Assuming these low degradation rates could be sustained well beyond the warranty period is potentially asking for trouble. And beyond technical concerns, there are also question marks over whether revenuefrom merchant sales will end up meeting asset owners expectations.Experience in the wind industry suggests otherwise. In Germany, for example, an oversupply of wind generation is already stressing the grid and leading to negative pricing, hardly a recipe for merchant riches.Against this backdrop, asset owners will likely either have to invest in battery storage to play the energy markets or find ways to operate their plants as cheaply as possible.The processes of solar operations and maintenance arealready highly optimized and may not offer a great deal of scope for further savings. But Vassilis Papaeconomou, managing director of asset management systems developer Alectris, said there could still be room for IT cost reduction.At present, Papaeconomou said, solar asset management and operations and maintenance teams rely on a range of IT systems that are costly to integrate and do not always work well together.He advocates the use of single integrated systems that would not only work more efficiently but could also be used as a long-term store of plant operations data, which would help smooth due diligence efforts when plants are sold.A trend I would expect to see is the digitalization of technology, he said. Were still in the Stone Age.\n",

            "title:   FERC Denies Rehearings on PJM Capacity Orders, in a Blow to States’ Renewables Plans\n",
            "summary: The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Thursday rejected requests to reconsider its controversial orders that will upend the $10-billion-per-year capacity market of mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM by forcing state-subsidized renewable energy resources to bid at higher prices that could render them uncompetitive.In Thursdays vote, FERCs Republican majority rejected rehearing requests from states that say their clean energy goals will be undermined if renewables are forced to bid at higher, administratively set prices.But for clean energy groups, there could be a silver lining.In denying therehearing requests, FERC has nowopenedthe door to legal challenges to its initial2018 orderthat threw out PJMs existing capacity market rules as unjust and unreasonable, as well as itsDecember2019 orderthat forces PJM to apply a minimum offer price rule (MOPR) to state-subsidized resources across its 11-state territory.Under the Federal Power Act, legal challenges to FERC decisions cant proceed until rehearing requests have been affirmed or denied.Were certainly totally opposed to these ordersand will continue fighting them wherever they can, Casey Roberts, senior attorney for the Sierra Club, said in a Thursday interview. While the Sierra Club hasnt yet filed a petition for review asking a federal court to take up its legal arguments against FERCs orders, I think its almost certain that the group will do so, she added.Legal challenges can be expected against FERC for failing to consider theincrease in capacity costs that could be passed on to the 65 million or so electricity customers served by utilities in PJM territory, Robert said, as lower-cost, state-subsidized resources are excluded and higher-cost power plants continue to win capacity contracts.States have also argued that FERC has overstepped its authority to regulate the interstate transmission of energy by directing its MOPR order only at state-subsidized resources as a market-distorting influence, while failing to address federal subsidies or private-party transactions that could also cause market imbalances, Robertssaid.Its really targeting state policy in ways that overstep what FERCs jurisdiction allows it to do.Clean-energy groups including theAmerican Wind Energy Association, the American Council on Renewable Energy, and Advanced Energy Economy are reviewing their options for making legal challenges, according to spokespeople contacted Thursday.These groups, along with the Solar Energy Industries Association, wrote in a joint statement on Thursday that they strongly oppose instituting the MOPR because it unjustifiably interferes with state decisions to bring low-cost and reliable clean energy to their communities.FERC is financially penalizing American consumers for the clean energy they want and deserve to bail out increasingly uneconomic fossil fuel generators, American Council on Renewable Energy CEO Gregory Wetstone wrote. As a result, we will be exploring our options to ensurethat state policies are respected and renewable deployment moves forward.A push to bring back the countrys biggest capacity auctionIn the meantime, clean-energy groups and fossil fuel power plant owners alike are pushing FERC to approvePJMs compliance filingfrom last month, despite their opposition to the underlying FERC orders that set it in place, so that PJM can resume its capacity market auctions. Those auctionshave been on ice since thelast one was held in 2018.Last months compliance filing from PJM set floor prices for most state-backed solar power, onshore and offshore wind and energy storage that are likely to be too high to compete againstnatural gas, nuclear or coal-fired power plants. But it also sets relatively low minimum prices for existing nuclear power plants and includes proposed rules that could lower the minimum bidding price of some solar and onshore wind resources to a level that could be competitive.While we remain opposed to the MOPR, we are hopeful that FERC will approve the pending PJM MOPR compliance filing, which better recognizes the important value that renewable energy can provide in a competitive capacity market,Amy Farrell, senior vice president ofgovernment and public affairs for theAmerican Wind Energy Association, saysin a statement released Thursday.Gas generators support FERCs ruling, but like solar and wind operators, theywant to see PJMs capacity auctions resume as quickly as possible. While the negative effects of FERCs order on state-backed renewables are expected to increase into the latter part of this decade, natural-gas power plantsarefar more relianton capacity revenuein the short term.In a statement, Todd Snitchler, CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents companies operating natural-gas power plants, pushed FERC to act quickly and ensure an expeditious timeline for allowing PJMs capacity auctions to restart.Snitchler noted thatFERCs actions have led several states with aggressive clean energy goals,including Illinoisand New Jersey, to consider actions thatcould pull them outof PJMs capacity market altogether. Our energy future hangs in the balance as some states consider drastic, destructive options such as abandoning regional markets, Snitchlerwrote.Chairman Chatterjee defends MOPR orderFERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee said on a conference call that Thursdays decisions will clear the way for FERC to consider that compliance filing, evenas it awaits a new compliance filing from PJM thats due in the next 45 days. He also clarified that FERCs MOPR order does not apply to voluntary renewable energy creditsor to trading in the footprint of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, because these transactions are not a type of payment or concession directly from states.Chatterjeedenied accusations from MOPR opponents that it the action willdrastically drive up capacity costs. As evidence, he pointed to aMarch analysisfrom PJMs independent market monitorthat found the changes ordered by FERC are not expected to have an impact on the clearing prices and auction revenues for PJMs next capacity auction.Opponents to FERCs order have pointed out, however, that this analysis fails to consider the likelihood that the costs to consumers are expected to rise dramatically in the years aheadas more and more state-subsidized renewables are subjected to the MOPR and denied access to PJMs capacity market. Because existing renewables are exempted from FERCs MOPR, their presence in auctions in the short term wont be suppressed.FERC completely failed to consider the impact on consumers from these orders, Sierra Clubs Roberts said.Richard Glick, FERCs sole Democratic member and the onlyno vote against FERCs December2019 decision, disagreed with Thursdays move to deny rehearing requests, calling it an attack on states authority to determine their own clean energy futures. Glick hascited independent analyses indicating the order could increase consumer costs by billions of dollars per year.On Thursdays conference call, Chatterjee pushed back on the premise that FERCs order would lead to large cost increases in the long term. I believe that markets drive competition and innovation, he said. Im also a big believer in the business case for renewables. I believe the costs of clean energy have come down now [to a degree] that they can compete without subsidies.Chatterjeedownplayed concerns that Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland and other states that have made initial moves to find alternatives to participating in PJMs capacity market will follow through. Organized competitive markets bring significant benefits to consumers. I think state leaders will be significantly pressed to ignore that.\n",

            "title:   In New York, a New Way for Stay-at-Home Customers to Get Paid for Shaving Peak Energy\n",
            "summary: New York is struggling with the countrys worst coronavirus outbreak, but its also pushing ahead on itsambitious clean energygoals. Those include major expansions ofwind and solar power, moreenergy storageto manage that intermittent supply and, on the demand side of the equation, programs that can turn utility customers from passive consumers into active grid-balancing participants.Take GridRewards, a program launched last week bycommunity-choice aggregatorSustainable Westchester and building energy software anddemand response providerLogical Buildings. Beyond providing efficiency tips and energy usage insights, GridRewards will give Sustainable Westchesters 115,000 or so customers a chance to get paid for reducing energy consumption when utility Con Edison needs to relieve its straining grid.Thats a timely offer for Westchester County residents stuck at home under the states COVID-19 restrictions and looking for ways to reduce rising utility bills. Its also a way for Logical Buildings to gain load-reduction capacity in the residential sector, which is seeing electricity usage rising even as New York Citys locked-downcommercial sectors demand is falling.Given the current situation with office buildings in New York, it actually gives us a massive advantage, David Klatt, Logical Buildings VP of operations, said in an interview this week. Were deploying to where the load has shifted.Elta Kolo, grid edge research content lead at Wood Mackenzie Power  Renewables, noted that residential demand response is a tough proposition for utilities, with high customer-acquisition costs and challenges in achieving reliable results and keeping customers engaged particularly if customers grow weary of being asked to reduce power too often.Still, the Sustainable Westchester program is rolling out at a moment when New York residents under stay-at-home orders are likely to be much more sensitive to rising utility bills. This is the time to engage customers, because of that hypersensitivity, Kolo said.Taking advantage of Con Edisons new smart metersWhile the move is timely, its also been years in the making. GridRewards is one of the first demand response programs in the state to take advantage of newly installedsmart meters from utilityCon Edison, which allow it to track residential and small-commercial customers energy use in 15-minute increments, a prerequisite for participating.Con Edison has installed more than 2 million smart meters to dateand plans to deploy nearly 5 million electric and gas meters by 2023. Thats a much larger pool of potential participants than the roughly 10,000 large commercial customers that make up its historical demand response pool, Klatt said.Having smart meters is only the first step, however. It took a year for Logical Buildings to integrate with theCon Edisons Green Button Connectsmart meter data system in a reliable and secure way, and to set up the process of enrolling new customers into its demand response management system as it upgraded from handling thousands of big commercial and industrial loads to millions of accounts.The result is a system that can connect customerswithin minutes,then downloadLogical BuildingsSmartKit AI application to their computer or smartphone, preloaded with your AMI data and all your insights, Klatt said.Thats quite a feat, considering that most utilities havent made smart meter data easy to access (although weve beentracking notable exceptionsto this rule).Behind the scenes of a mass-market demand response programLogical Buildingsplays a key role in aggregating Sustainable Westchester customers in Con Edisons two primarycommercial demand responseprograms:theCommercial System Relief Program (CSRP)and Distribution Load Relief Program (DLRP).The CSRP is the more forgiving of the two programs, giving 21-hour advance notice to reduce load for up to four hours at a time to meet Con Edisons systemwide peaks. The DLRP is more stringent, giving twohours ofadvance notice to shed load for four hours at a time to mitigate local network constraints; it also offers more lucrative payments in return.For participating customers in Westchester County, the payments equate to $24 per kilowatt per month, or up to $120 over the programsMay-to-September run period, plus a few dollars of performance payments of $1 per kilowatt-hour of reduction, Klatt said.Thats more lucrative than Con Edisons smart thermostat program for individual residential or small-commercial customers, which offers a one-time $50 rebate, plus $25 per summer for customers who let Con Edison remotely control their Wi-Fi-enabled Nest or Honeywell smart thermostats.Con Edison also offers a program for remote-controllable window air conditioning units that can paybetween $25 to $250per summer, but only if customers fully participate throughout the summer a challenge during the hottest days of the year.The Sustainable Westchester program, by contrast, can pay customers for reducing electricity use below a predetermined baseline, whether its from turning thermostats up by a few degrees, turning off lightsor choosing to run dishwashers, washing machines and other high-consumption appliances at different hours of the day.In aggregating these customers, Logical Buildings also takes the risk that the customers may fail to follow through. Thats a huge challenge for us, Klatt said, as it is for other \"behavioraldemand response\"programs that rely on customers making decisions at the momentrather than on automated load controls. We dont yet know with certainty how the smaller users are going to perform.One mitigating factor is that CSRP and DLRP dont penalize nonperformance, unlike the Special Case Resources program run bystate grid operator NYISO. Still, Logical Buildings will be building its portfolio of small energy users carefully, matching them with larger commercial loads it already manages and which have proven themselves to be reliable, he said.Sustainable Westchester will undertake an ambitiousmarketing initiative to encourage customers to sign upand to use the data coming from their smart meters to make more informed decisions, GridRewardsprogram director Michel Delafontaine said. That will be helpful as Con Edison moves toward time-of-use pricing to connect what customers pay for power with the shifting costs of generating and distributing it, he added.Much of the early work on this front has been connected with valuing distributed energy resourceslike rooftop solar and behind-the-meter energy storage. But with the state moving toclose gas-fired and nuclear powerplants that supply local grid stability, the community-choice aggregator is also eager to enlist demand-side resources to provide capacity to make up for those closures.\n",

            "summary: Shell on Thursday announced a net-zeroemissions target for 2050, becomingthe second major European oil company after BP to embrace such agoal.An expanded power business will make the biggest contribution to the shift but renewables investment will playa major role.The British-Dutchfirm will also target\"Scope 3\" emissions, which encompassthe end use of its products.Scope 3 emissions account for 85 percent of the companys ultimate carbon footprint.Shell also committed toaligning its efforts with the Paris Agreements goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In a call with investors, CEO Ben van Beurden said restricting warming to1.5 degrees Celsius was \"just about\" economically and technologically possible. \"Were not going to turn into a charity or[a nongovernmental organization]. This only works if there is money to be made, [otherwise] it is not viable,\" he said.At the heart of Shells plan is ashift to selling less oilandmore power and natural gasover time. To reduce its own emissions, thecompany will continue theexpansion of its already-sizable renewables business and improve the efficiency of its operations. It will also rely oncarbon offsets like planting trees.Luke Parker, vice president ofcorporate analysisat Wood Mackenzie, said the announcement represents an \"evolution\" of the net-carbon footprint Shell unveiled in 2017. The company \"has effectively accelerated its ambition to reduce the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 65 percentby 2050, instead of 50 percent,\" Parker said.The interim ambition shifts to 30 percentby 2035, instead of 20 percent,\" Parker added. \"Shell sees this as bringing the company in line with changed societal ambitions for 1.5 degeres C, rather than 2 degrees C, as previously targeted.\"BP revealed its own net-zeroambitioninFebruary, with details expected to follow laterthis year. Spains Repsol was thefirstoil company to include Scope 3 emissions in a net-zero target.In recent years Shell has become an increasingly importantinvestor in renewable energy around the world:It is the largest shareholder in U.S. solar developer Silicon Ranch Corporation and it owns energy storage firmsonnen, as part of a stable of other projects and investments covering EV charging,floating wind technologyandgreen hydrogen. It also has stakes in fouroffshore winddevelopments on either side of the Atlantic.In Europe, Shell suppliespowerto a range of energy-intensive users like chemical plants and other heavy industry, and it has developed a retail electricity business after acquiring U.K. supplier First Utility.

(Credit: Shell)The transformation of Shells own business is a huge challenge. Even bigger will be tackling societal emissions from the consumption of its energy products.In part, those will be dealt with as part of a shift toward a \"net-zero society,\" Shell acknowledged.The company plans to work on decarbonization pathways with a variety of sectorsthrough efficiency, offsets andcarbon-capture technology. In Europe, many of these industries will be dragged towardnet-zero operations by the EUs Green Deal policy. It is targeting net-zero emissions by 2050, across the entire economy.Some environmental groups were not convinced by Shells announcement.A credible net-zero plan from Shell would start with a commitment to stop drilling for new oil and gas,\" said Richard George, head of Greenpeace U.K.s climate campaign. Instead, investors are being fobbed off with vague aspirations that dont tackle Shells monstrous carbon footprint and pass the buck to Shells customers to offset their emissions.\"Van Buerden said the COVID-19 pandemic, which has contributed to a collapse in global oil prices, has not weakened Shells will on the energy transition.With the COVID-19 pandemic having a serious impact on peoples health and our economies, these are extraordinary times,\" van Buerden said in a statement.\"Yet even at this time of immediate challenge, we must also maintain the focus on the long term.\"Shells announcement underlines its commitment to transitioning from \"Big Oil to Big Energy,\" said WoodMacs Parker.\"Coronavirus and its fallout dont change that;if anything, it adds greater weight to the argument. Despite immediate cash flow constraints, Shelland its peerswill emerge from this period more determined to make the shift.Shell said its current budgets and business plans do not reflect the newly announced objectives and will be adjusted soon.\n",
